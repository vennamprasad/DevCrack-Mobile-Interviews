## 1. The Golden Rule: Impact > Activity

Reviewers spend **6 seconds** on your resume. They don't care *what* you did, they care *what effect* it had.

**Formula:** `[Action Verb] + [Task] + [Result/Metric]`

| ❌ Weak (Activity) | ✅ Strong (Impact) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Worked on the login screen." | "Redesigned Login flow, reducing drop-off rate by **15%** and improving specific load time by **200ms**." |
| "Fixed memory leaks using LeakCanary." | "Eliminated **50+** memory leaks in the checkout flow, reducing crash-free rate from **98% to 99.9%**." |
| "Used Retrofit for API calls." | "Migrated network layer to Retrofit/Coroutines, reducing boilerplate code by **40%** and handling offline caching." |
| "Managed a team of 3 juniors." | "Mentored 3 junior engineers to promotion within 12 months; introduced weekly code review cycles." |

## 2. Structure & Layout

### 1. Header
*   Name
*   Role (e.g., Senior iOS Engineer)
*   Links: GitHub, LinkedIn, Portfolio (Ensure links are clickable).
*   *Avoid:* Full Address (City/State is enough), Photo (US/UK markets).

### 2. Professional Summary (Optional)
*   Only include if you have a unique value proposition.
*   *Example:* "Android/iOS Engineer with 8 years exp. Specialist in Video Streaming apps (Ex-Netflix) and Low-level NDK optimization."

### 3. Experience (Reverse Chronological)
*   **Company Name** | **Role** | **Dates**
*   3-4 Bullet points per role.
*   Focus on your *wins*.

### 4. Skills
*   Group them: Languages, Frameworks, Tools, CI/CD.

### 5. Education
*   Degree, University. (Move to bottom if you have >3 years experience).

## 4. Common Mistakes

1.  **Skill Bars:** (e.g., "Java: 80%"). This is subjective and meaningless. Don't use them.
2.  **Too Long:** Keep it to **1 Page** (unless 10+ years exp, then 2 pages max).
3.  **Typos:** In "Attention to detail".
4.  **Generic Objectives:** "Looking for a challenging role..." (Delete this).
5.  **Broken Links:** Check your GitHub link!

## 5. Template (Before vs After)

### Before (Junior/Weak)
> **Role:** Android Developer
> *   Wrote code for the new chat feature.
> *   Used Kotlin and MVVM.
> *   Fixed bugs in JIRA.
> *   Attended daily standups.

### After (Senior/Strong)
