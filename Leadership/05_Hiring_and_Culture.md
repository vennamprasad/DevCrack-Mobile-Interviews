## 1. Interviewing Candidates

### Q1. How do you structure a technical interview?
**Answer:**
- **Intro (5m):** Warm up, introduce yourself, sell the company.
- **Project Deep Dive (10-15m):** Ask them about a past challenge. Look for depth. ("Why did you choose X?", "What would you change?").
- **Coding/System Design (30-40m):** Practical problem.
    - *Senior:* Focus on trade-offs, scalability, edge cases.
    - *Junior:* Focus on logic, code cleanliness, ability to take hints.
- **Q&A (5-10m):** Allow them to interview you. This is crucial for their candidate experience.

### Q2. What signals do you look for in a "Senior" candidate?
**Answer:**
- **Communication:** Can they explain complex concepts simply?
- **Trade-offs:** do they know there is no "perfect" solution? (e.g., "We used X because Y, but the downside was Z").
- **Ownership:** Do they say "I" for their contributions and "We" for team wins?
- **Mentorship:** Do they care about growing others?

### Q3. How do you reduce bias in interviewing?
**Answer:**
- **Standardized Rubric:** Grade everyone on the same criteria (e.g., "Code Quality", "Communication") before discussing with the hiring committee.
- **Diverse Panel:** Ensure the interview panel is diverse (gender, background).
- **Shadowing:** Have a second person shadow the interview to validate observations.

## 2. Onboarding New Hires

### Q4. Describe your 30-60-90 day plan for a new hire.
**Answer:**
- **Day 1-30 (Learn):** Setup env, ship one small bug fix ("First Commit" dopamine), meet the team, understand the product domain.
- **Day 31-60 (Contribute):** Pick up standard features. Participate in code reviews.
- **Day 61-90 (Own):** Own a small project or feature end-to-end. Suggest improvements.

### Q5. How do you ensure a new hire feels welcome?
**Answer:**
- **Onboarding Buddy:** Assign a peer (not manager) for daily questions.
- **Documentation:** Ensure READMEs work.
- **Social:** Team lunch or virtual coffee.
- **Psychological Safety:** Explicitly tell them: "You are expected to have questions. It's okay not to know things."

## 3. Building Team Culture

### Q6. How do you build a "Safe" culture (Psychological Safety)?
**Answer:**
- **Admit Mistakes:** Leaders must say "I was wrong" publicly.
- **Blameless Post-Mortems:** Focus on process failure, not human error.
- **Encourage Dissent:** "Does anyone see a reason why this might fail?"
- **Zero Tolerance for Toxicity:** Shut down interruptions or rude behavior immediately.

### Q7. How do you handle remote/distributed teams?
**Answer:**
- **Async First:** Write it down. Decisions shouldn't happen in water-cooler chats.
- **Over-communicate:** Context is lost in text.
- **Social Time:** Dedicate time for non-work chat (zoom games, coffee chats) to build empathy.

## 4. Real-World Scenarios

### Q8. Scenario: A candidate does great in coding but is arrogant/rude. Do you hire?
**Answer:**
**No.** "No Asshole Rule".
- **Reason:** One toxic person can destroy the productivity of the entire team. Technical skills can be taught; attitude is harder to change.

### Q9. Scenario: You realize a new hire is struggling significantly in month 2.
**Answer:**
- **Intervene Early:** Don't wait for the 90-day review.
- **Investigate:** Is it an onboarding failure? (Did we not document X?).
- **Plan:** specific, smaller tasks to build confidence.
- **Decision:** If no improvement despite support, "Hire fast, fire faster" (during probation) is better for both parties.

### Q10. Scenario: How do you improve the diversity of your team?
**Answer:**
- **Top of Funnel:** Source from diverse platforms/bootcamps.
- **Job Description:** Remove gender-coded language (e.g., "Ninja", "Rockstar"). Focus on "Growth mindset".
- **Interview Loop:** ensure diverse representation in the panel.
