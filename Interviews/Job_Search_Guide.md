## 🔍 Level 1: Google "X-Ray" Search (The Real Cheat Code)
Recruiters use these strings to find *you*. You can use them to find *jobs* and *hiring managers* that standard LinkedIn search hides.

### 1. Find Hiring Managers (Skip HR)
Paste these into Google to find potential bosses posting about openings.
```text
site:linkedin.com/in "hiring" AND "Android" AND "Manager" AND "Bangalore"
site:linkedin.com/post "hiring" AND "Android Developer" AND "remote"
site:twitter.com "hiring" AND "Android" AND "DM open"
```

### 2. Find Unlisted Jobs on ATS (Greenhouse, Lever)
Many startups post on their ATS but forget to promote on LinkedIn.
```text
site:boards.greenhouse.io "Android Engineer"
site:jobs.lever.co "Android Developer"
site:breezy.hr "Mobile Developer"
```

### 3. Find "Hidden" PDFs/Resumes (Competitor Analysis)
See what successfully hired candidates put on their resumes.
```text
filetype:pdf "resume" AND "Android Developer" AND "Google"
```

## 📧 Level 2: Cold Messaging Templates (High Response Rate)
**Rule #1:** Keep it under 50 words.
**Rule #2:** Don't ask for a job. Ask for advice/connection.

### Template A: To a Peer (Developer at Target Company)
*Subject: Quick q about engineering at [Company]*

> "Hi [Name], huge fan of [Company]'s recent work on [Specific Feature]. I'm an Android dev with 4 years exp (ex-[Previous Company]).
>
> I see you're on the mobile team there. Could I ask 1 quick question about the tech stack you use? Not looking for a referral right now, just genuinely curious. Thanks!"

### Template B: To a Hiring Manager
*Subject: Your post about the Android role*

> "Hi [Name], saw your post about the Android opening.
>
> I successfully shipped [Project X] at [Current Company] which improved crash-free rate to 99.9% — seems relevant to the stability challenges you mentioned.
>
> Attached my resume. Open to a 5-min chat if this sounds interesting. Best, [Your Name]"

### Template C: The "Trojan Horse" (Referral Request)
*Don't ask "Can you refer me?". Ask this:*
> "Hi [Name], I'm applying to the Android role at [Company].
>
> I know referrals often come with a bonus for employees. Would you be open to referring me if I send you my details + a blurb about why I'm a good fit? Happy to do the legwork so it takes 30s for you."

## 📄 Level 3: Resume "Hack" (ATS Optimization)
The Application Tracking System (ATS) is a robot. Speak its language.

1.  **Keywords > Grammar:** If the JD says "MVVM", and you have "Model-View-ViewModel", change it to "MVVM".
2.  **No Columns/Graphics:** Simple single-column layouts parse 100% correctly. Complex designs get garbled.
3.  **Metrics, Not Duties:**
    *   ❌ "Worked on login screen."
    *   ✅ "Revamped login flow, reducing drop-off by 15%."
4.  **Invisible Keyword Stuffing (Use with Caution):**
    *   *Technique:* Paste the entire Job Description at the bottom of your resume in 1pt white font.
    *   *Risk:* Human recruiters might see it when selecting text. Better to weave keywords naturally.

## 🚀 Level 4: Platform Strategy

### LinkedIn
*   **The "Open to Work" Signal:** Turn it on for "Recruiters Only" immediately.
*   **Activity:** Commenting on 5 posts/day boosts your profile visibility to the commenter's network.

### Naukri (India Specific)
*   **The "Freshness" Algorithm:** Update your profile *every single morning*. Even if you just add a comma and remove it. 'updated today' profiles rank #1 for recruiters.

### Wellfound (AngelList)
*   Best for startup jobs. Direct access to founders.
*   **Strategy:** Apply, then immediately DM the founder on Twitter/LinkedIn. "Just applied on Wellfound, loved your mission X."
