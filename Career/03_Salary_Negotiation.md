## 1. The Mindset

*   **Recruiters expect you to negotiate.** It is not rude; it is business.
*   **Your greatest leverage is:**
    1.  **Multiple Offers.**
    2.  **Willingness to walk away.**
*   **Impact:** A 10-minute conversation can earn you $10k-$50k more per year.

## 2. Knowing Your Worth (Levels)

Understanding tech compensation levels (FAANG/Big Tech standards):

*   **L3 / E3 (Junior):** ~0-2 years. Core execution.
*   **L4 / E4 (Mid-Level):** ~2-5 years. Independent execution.
*   **L5 / E5 (Senior):** ~5-8 years. System design, mentoring.
*   **L6 / E6 (Staff):** ~8+ years. Cross-team impact.

*Resources:* levels.fyi, Blind.

## 3. The Negotiation Process

1.  **The Initial Screen:** "What are your salary expectations?"
    *   *Do not give a number.*
    *   *Say:* "I'm focusing on the role fit right now, but I'm looking for a competitive package commensurate with my experience."
2.  **The Offer:** They give you a number.
    *   *Say:* "Thank you. I need some time to digest this and discuss with my family. Can we speak again on Thursday?"
    *   *Never accept immediately.*
3.  **The Counter:**
    *   Research market rate.
    *   Prepare your "Ask" (usually Offer + 10-20%).
    *   Communicate value.

## 4. Scripts & Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Avoiding giving the first number
**Recruiter:** "We need a number to move forward."
**You:** "I understand. Can you share the salary band budgeted for this position? I want to make sure we are in the same ballpark."

### Scenario 2: The Lowball Offer
**Recruiter:** "We can offer $120k." (You know market is $150k).
**You:** "I'm really excited about the team and the product. However, looking at the market data and the scope of responsibilities we discussed (leading the migration to Compose), I was expecting something closer to $160k. Is there flexibility there?"

### Scenario 3: Leveraging another offer
**You:** "I have received an offer from Company X for $170k. I prefer your company because of the culture/product. If you can match $170k, I will sign immediately."
*(Only say "sign immediately" if you mean it).*

## 5. Equity (RSUs vs Options)

*   **RSUs (Restricted Stock Units):** "Real money" (for public companies). Taxed as income upon vesting.
*   **Stock Options (ISOs/NSOs):** The *right* to buy stock. High risk (might be worth $0).
*   **Vesting Schedule:** Standard is 4 years (25% cliff after 1 year).
*   **Negotiation Tip:** Equity is often more flexible/negotiable than Base Salary. If they hit a ceiling on Base, ask for more Equity or a Sign-on Bonus.
