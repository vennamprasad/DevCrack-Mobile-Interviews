## ✅ What is MVP?

**MVP (Model-View-Presenter)** is a design pattern used to separate the presentation layer from the business logic. It’s commonly used in Android development, especially with XML-based UI (pre-Jetpack Compose).

It improves testability and code organization by decoupling UI from business logic.

User interacts with View

Presenter processes logic, updates Model

Model returns data to Presenter

Presenter updates the View

## 🧩 Components of MVP

| Component     | Responsibility                                                                  |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**     | Handles business logic, data operations, API calls, and database interactions.  |
| **View**      | Interface representing the UI (Activity/Fragment or custom View).               |
| **Presenter** | Acts as a middleman. Fetches data from the Model and updates the View.          |

---

## 📱 Example (Login Flow)

1. **User** enters email/password → `View` sends data to `Presenter`
2. **Presenter** validates input, requests login from `Model`
3. **Model** returns success or failure
4. **Presenter** tells `View` to show result (e.g., success message or error)

---

## ✅ Benefits

- **Improved testability**: Business logic is in Presenter, which can be unit tested easily.
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI and logic.
- **Reusable View and Presenter contracts**: Easier to swap UI components.

---

## ⚠️ Drawbacks

- Can lead to **boilerplate code**, especially with large View interfaces.
- The **Presenter** can become large if not well-structured (known as "God class").
- Manual **View-to-Presenter** binding can be tedious.

## 🔄 Comparison with MVC & MVVM & MVI

| Pattern | Data Flow            | State Type   | Testability | Common Use Case          |
|--------|----------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| MVC    | Bidirectional         | Mutable      | Medium      | Legacy systems/web        |
| MVP    | View → Presenter → Model | Mutable | Good        | Android (pre-Compose)     |
| MVVM   | View ↔ ViewModel (LiveData) | Mutable | Very Good   | Modern Android XML        |
| MVI    | Intent → Model → ViewState → View | Immutable | Excellent | Jetpack Compose/Redux    |

## 🛠️ Sample Interface Contracts

```kotlin
// View
interface LoginView {
    fun showLoading()
    fun hideLoading()
    fun showError(message: String)
    fun navigateToHome()
}

// Presenter
interface LoginPresenter {
    fun onLoginClicked(email: String, password: String)
}
